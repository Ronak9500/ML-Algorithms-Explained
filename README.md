# ML Algorithms Explained

Welcome to the ML Algorithms Explained repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to various machine learning algorithms, explaining them in both simple and programmatic terms.

## Structure

Each algorithm has its own directory containing:
- A `README.md` file with a layman's explanation.
- A Python script implementing the algorithm.
- An example Jupyter notebook demonstrating the algorithm in action.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ronak9500/ML-Algorithms-Explained/
